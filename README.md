# Random Number Guessing Game (Python)

This is a simple beginner-level Python program that generates a random number and asks the user to guess it. The program validates the user input and then checks whether the guessed number matches the randomly generated number.

## How It Works

- The user is prompted to enter a guess
- The input is checked to make sure it is a valid number
- If the guess is correct, the user wins
- If the guess is wrong, the correct number is displayed

## Concepts Used
- User input
- Conditional statements (`if / else`)
- Random number generation
- Basic input validation
- Python standard library

## How to Run
1. Make sure Python is installed
